# Simple Todo App

A simple and clean to-do list app that helps keep daily tasks organized.

## Functionality

Users can add new tasks, mark them as complete, and delete them when they’re done. The app updates in real time and gives visual feedback when tasks are completed. It’s designed to be minimal and easy to use, with a focus on functionality over flash.

## Technology

I used vanilla JavaScript with an object-oriented programming approach, organizing the logic into reusable classes to keep the code clean and modular

## Deployment
